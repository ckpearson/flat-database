# flat-database
A very bare-bones way of storing application data.

## Motivation
Sometimes all you need to do is put together a very simple file-based storage for application data, when a full-on database is overkill, and the thought of using isolated storage fills you with dread.

## License
Code probably says GPL, you can treat it as MIT though, it's old code and I've changed my mind about the licensing.

## How to Use
Example usage can be found in the source, it's pretty simple though (a few lines)

## Fame
For a brief moment this was featured on Coding4Fun (https://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/blog/the-world-is-just-a-flat-database) back when I was hosting on CodePlex!
